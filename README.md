# Coding Gigs App (Tutorial Followed)

## Description

For this project, I followed along with Traversy Media's 3-part Sequelize tutorial on Youtube. While the project is not my own creation, the tutorials helped me digest some of the fundamentals that I have been learning in my coding bootcamp up to this point, specifically regarding Express.js, Sequelize, and Handlebars.
